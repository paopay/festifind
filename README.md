### Description

This was a simple web app created for the Music Hack Day SF Hackathon at GitHub headquarters. We used this as an opportunity to practice coding as well as an excuse to see all the cool projects other people were working on.

Our app is built in Ruby on Rails and makes use of the Songkick, Echo Nest, and Rdio APIs. It allows users to listen to the music from upcoming festivals.

***

### Important

 
 The database needs to be seeded and `rake scrap_songkick` needs to be run in order for initial seeding. Furthermore, it takes about 5 minutes for the entire database to seed, depending on the size of the festival collection. After this point, run your sever and go to the link localhost:3000/admin/generate'
